Thanks for helping make my project safe for everyone.

## Security

I take the security of my software products seriously, including all of the open source code repositories managed through my profile, such as [anhgelus](https://github.com/anhgelus).

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of my repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to william.herges[@]proton.me.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

* The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
